# graphql-react-playground
In this project I play around with these technologies in order to learn more

Essentially GraphQL is a query language that we can use to build an API. In order to do this
we have to:
 * Define our **schema** -  type system representing our data model to use when validating and executing a query.
 * Define **root queries** - the top level type that represents all possible entry points into the GraphQL API from any client on the front end.
