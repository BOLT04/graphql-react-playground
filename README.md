# graphql-react-playground
In this project I play around with these technologies in order to learn more

Essentially GraphQL is a query language that we can use to build an API. In order to do this
we have to:
 * Define our **schema** -  type system representing our data model to use when validating and executing a query.
 * Define **root queries** - the top level type that represents all possible entry points into the GraphQL API from any client on the front end.
 
 I also interacted with GraphiQL, using it to test out the code that I was doing and explore what is possible as far as queries go. This tool also allows me to easily check the docs on the GraphQL server that is being used. This way i have quick access to all the information i need.
